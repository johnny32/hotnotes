HotNotes - A student's social network
==============

HotNotes is my final degree project on Computer Science at the University of Girona. It is scheduled for late june of 2014.

This application is a social network that allows registered students to share, comment and review documents that other users have shared. The website filters the documents by the subjects the students are registered in, and offers a main page where they can quickly see the latest uploaded documents on their subjects.
